            <p><strong>Pink Floyd</strong> were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a
                psychedelic band, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation,
                philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows,
                and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially
                successful and influential groups in popular music history.</p>
            <p>Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar and lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger
                Waters (bass and vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they
                released two charting singles and a successful
                debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in
                December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became their
                primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising
                the concepts behind the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals
                (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The band also composed several film scores.</p>
            <p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and
                Mason continued as Pink Floyd, joined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary
                Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell
                (1994)—and continued to tour before quietly disbanding in 1995. In 2005, all the members except Barrett
                reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and
                Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio
                album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased
                material from The Division Bell recording sessions.</p>
            <p>Pink Floyd are considered one of the first groups of British psychedelia and are credited with inspiring
                the development of genres such as progressive rock and ambient music. They had four albums that topped
                US or UK record charts; the songs "See
                Emily Play" (1967) and "Another Brick in the Wall" (1982) were the group's only top 10 singles in either
                territory. The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall
                of Fame in 2005. By 2013, they had
                sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall two of the
                best-selling albums of all time.</p>
